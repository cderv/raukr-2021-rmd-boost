**palmerpinguins** (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins) is an R package to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to iris.

Let's look into it ! 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

The `penguins` data contains the following 

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```


# General metric

We have `r length(unique(penguins$species))` species into this datasets: `r knitr::combine_words(unique(penguins$species))` that are not equally reparted

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(species)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png")
```


We can get some interesting mean metrics for each species:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  select(-year) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We can also look at whare they live: 

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```
